# Gamedev Feedback
Public repo for future Gamedev Feedback segments.

Use https://github.com/Silverware-Games/Gamedev-Feedback/issues to submit a game for us to do feedback, you should be signed into GitHub. Or email michael@silverwaregames.com 

Rules:

* We make the final decision to cover a game or not.
* Respectful criticue is the goal here, feel free to comment on our videos in a meaningful and constructive way, and we will do the same.
* No game is perfect. If you think your game is perfect, then don't show it to us, we will have no feedback.
* We may get to a point where we cannot cover all the games that come in, we hope to explain why we didn't cover something rather than just writing you off. Please reach out if you have questions.
