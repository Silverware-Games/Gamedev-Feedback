# Gamedev Feedback
Our goal is to provide meaningful honest feedback to games that are still being developed so that devs can find UI/UX things to improve and change as well as new potential features. If we get stuck, we get stuck, I can't say we'll figure out everything, but if we do get lost it might help you figure out how to make your game easier to understand for n00b players like us!

We also hope to showcase your game so it becomes a hit! Currently we can only cover PC/iOS games without VR. Sorry. This is a public repo for future Gamedev Feedback segments where future segements are listed in the "issues" section.

Use https://github.com/Silverware-Games/Gamedev-Feedback/issues to submit a game for us to do feedback, please link to the game as well as how we can reach you to get a key for the game. DO NOT POST THE GAME KEY PUBLICLY. You should be signed into GitHub. 

Or you can always email michael@silverwaregames.com 

# Rules:

* We make the final decision to cover a game or not.
* We are always willing to show you a video before we post it live in case you don't want it to be public.
* Respectful criticue is the goal here, feel free to comment on our videos in a meaningful and constructive way, and we will do the same.
* No game is perfect. If you think your game is perfect, then don't show it to us, we will have no feedback.
* We may get to a point where we cannot cover all the games that come in, we hope to explain why we didn't cover something rather than just writing you off. Please reach out if you have questions.

# Titles, Thumbnails, and Viewership

We want these videos to get seen. These are videos made by small indie creators with love and we want their games to get an audience. Also we want our channel to get viewers, everyone wins. In order to get this to work, we are using ... dun dun duhh ... "Best Practices." That means we are creating thumbnails with AI that have big faces with open mouths and text on them, as well as using AI to generate titles that will get people to click on the videos. If you have suggestions on how to beat the algorithm let us know.
