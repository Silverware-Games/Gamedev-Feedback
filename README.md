# Gamedev Feedback
Public repo for future Gamedev Feedback segments.

Use https://github.com/Silverware-Games/Gamedev-Feedback/issues to submit a game for us to do feedback, you should be signed into GitHub. Or email michael@silverwaregames.com 

# Rules:

* We make the final decision to cover a game or not.
* We are always willing to show you a video before we post it live in case you don't want it to be public.
* Respectful criticue is the goal here, feel free to comment on our videos in a meaningful and constructive way, and we will do the same.
* No game is perfect. If you think your game is perfect, then don't show it to us, we will have no feedback.
* We may get to a point where we cannot cover all the games that come in, we hope to explain why we didn't cover something rather than just writing you off. Please reach out if you have questions.
